                <p>Hi, in my portfolio, are a few sites that I've developed. I believe my strong points are my Creativeness and Punctuality. My #1 goal will always be to meet your needs and deadline. When working on a new project, I like to speak with the client, so that I can have a clear understanding of his/her needs and vision of the project.
                    Please take a look at my work history for comments from other clients. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to working with you soon.
                    I graduated Donets'k National University, in the Ukraine. Listed below are my experience and skills.
                </p>
